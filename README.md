matcher-comparison
==================

Comparing a few python matcher libraries.  These help when writing tests by condensing common actions into more understandable and concise code.

I'm unsure why, but running setup.py fails on installing sure. The current work-around is
to install the packages by hand.

```
pip install sure
pip install should-dsl
pip install pyHamcrest
```
